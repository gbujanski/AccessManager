# Access Manager

While working on various projects, I often need a ready-to-use authentication and user management system.
Instead of building it from scratch every time, I created this boilerplate with the essential features already implemented:

- ASP.NET backend
- Angular frontend
- PostgreSQL database
- Built-in authentication and user management

The goal is to speed up the start of new applications â€” so I can focus on the business logic without wasting time on the basics of authentication and account management.
